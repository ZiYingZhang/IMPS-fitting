# IMPS fiting
A matlab package is used to fit and plot intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) data. The datasets contain the photocurrent response as a function of the frequency of a light perturbation. This data can be fitted using a dynamics model firstly proposed by Peter, L. M et al. [*Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry, 396(1-2), 219-226*].
Herein, the users can put the fitting codes (the main.m and the obj.m files) and the experiment data (datasets provided at 4 potentials) in one folder and modify the path, initial values, and boundary conditions, the dynamic parameters will be output if it can converge successfully.
